# Workshop Description

The application of robotic solutions to healthcare has soared in the past two decades, spanning from rigid to flexible and fully soft robots which can aid in diagnosis and therapy inside the human body. Control, design, sensing and fabrication of these robots is based on understanding their behaviour and interaction with the anatomy; this is a major challenge and general approaches are hard to define. 
In addressing this fundamental challenge, researchers have considered several techniques which range from model-based to data-driven approaches. The former are based on mechanically accurate modelling, while the latter focus on information provided from data and are devoted to learning. 
The workshop aims at bringing together researchers in the main fields of medical robotics to debate the importance of data with respect to modelling. The goal is to understand areas to explore and how researchers can combine these main approaches, towards improving the current practice in the study of medical robots.

This workshop will be an **full-day workshop** at [IROS 2023](https://ieee-iros.org/), on <b>October 5, 2023</b> from **9:00 am** to **5:00 pm**. Workshop schedule [here](https://medrob-workshop.github.io/schedule/).

Two-submissions for [**Pioneers of Medical Robotics**](# Pioneers of Medical Robotics ) will be featured where two stellar doctoral/post-doctoral candidates will present their bodies of work. **Conference registration** for the **Pioneers** is fully-funded by our Platinum Sponsors.

The workshop will also feature late breaking results as [**Poster Submissions**](# Poster Submissions). Scroll down for more details.

# Pioneers of Medical Robotics 
We introduce the **Pioneers of Medical Robotics** award as part of our workshop. Two rising-stars in medical robotics will be selected to give a 12(+3) minute talk about their research in the workshop.

Doctoral and Post-doctoral students are encouraged to submit a **1-page summary of their work and their CV** as **a single PDF document** to [this link](https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/2023/IROS/Workshop/DMMR&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)).

**IROS23 Registration for the Pioneers** will be sponsored by our Platinum Sponsor [**Staubli**](https://www.staubli.com/global/en/robotics.html).

Submission window opens on **July 6, 2023**. 

**Submission Deadline is August 6, 2023**. 

For any questions, please reach out to [info.medrob.workshop@gmail.com](mailto:info.medrob.workshop@gmail.com).

# Poster Submissions
Data vs. Model in Medical Robotics will feature poster presentations.
