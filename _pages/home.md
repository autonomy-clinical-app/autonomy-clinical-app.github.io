# Workshop Description

Minimally invasive endoluminal interventions have revolutionized the way we bring diagnostic and curative aid to deep-seated diseases. They are associated with reduced pain and recovery time, when compared to open surgery. However, the lack of direct visual access, the reduced dexterity, and minimal haptic feedback pose challenges for clinicians. Consequently, the number of highly skilled clinical personnel able to perform minimally invasive procedures is very limited. This means that few patients can access higher standards of care. 

Robotic platforms to date have successfully made minimally invasive surgery comparable to open surgery in terms of dexterity and visualization capabilities. However, using robots to increase every clinicianâ€™s skill level, regardless of task difficulty, expertise, and fatigue, remains elusive. To change this, we need to revolutionize the way we think of medical robots and evolve from considering them as mere tools. We need to create robotic platforms which provide optimal planning of complex procedures and, when appropriate, automation of procedural steps.

This workshop aims at bringing together experts from the medical robotics community to discuss how we can leverage intelligent design, planning, sensing, and control for the next generation of autonomous endoluminal medical robots.

The workshop will be an **full-day workshop** at [IROS 2024](https://iros2024-abudhabi.org/), on <b>October 15, 2024</b> from <b>8:30 am</b> to <b>5:00 pm</b>. Workshop schedule [here](https://autonomy-clinical-app.github.io/schedule/).

The workshop will feature late breaking results as [**Poster Submissions**](#poster-submissions). Scroll down for more details.
